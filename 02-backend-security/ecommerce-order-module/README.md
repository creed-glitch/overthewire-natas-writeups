# E-Commerce Order Processing Module

Author: Cha'Tara Reed

## Overview

This project contains the **Order History backend module** for a Python-based e-commerce bookstore application.

The system was developed as part of a **3-person team project**. My responsibility was designing and implementing the order processing and order history functionality using SQLite.

The module manages order creation, order tracking, and the transfer of cart items into finalized orders.

# Responsibiliities

As the backend developer responsible for the order system, I implemented:

- Order creation and order tracking
- Unique order ID generation
- Rretrieval of user order history
- Detailed order inspection
- Cart-to-order item transfer logic
- Database interaction using parameterized SQL queries
- Validation to ensure users can only view their own orders

---

## Secuirty Considerations

Several secure coding practices were used in this module:

- Parametrized SQL queries prevent SQL injection
- Order ownership validation prevents unauthorized access to other users' orders
- Unique order ID generation prevents collisions
- Controlled database connection handling reduces risk of database corruption
