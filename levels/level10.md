# Natas Level 10 -> 11

# Primary Security Concept
Advanced command injection with input filtering bypass

---

# Approach 
- Analyzed input filtering mechanisms blocking previous injection techniques
- Crafted alternative payloads to bypass input sanitization
- Leveraged logic flaws in filtering to execute injected system commands
- Retrieved protected credentials from restricted directories

---

# Outcome
Successfully bypassed filtering mechanisms and retrieved the password for level 11.
