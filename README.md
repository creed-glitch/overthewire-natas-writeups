OverTheWire Natas - Web Security Challenge Writeups (Levels 0-10)

Project Overview: 
This repository documents my complettion of OverTheWire Natas Levels 0-10, a series of progressivley difficult web application 
security challenges designed to teach real-world vulnerability discovery and explotiation techniques.

Each Level includes:
Vulnerability identification
Exploitation methodology 
Outcome
Screenshot evidence

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in web application security testing, ethical hacking, vulnerability analysis, and 
professional security documentation.

Skills Demonstrated:
Web Application Security Testing
Vulnerability Analysis
Ethical Hacking Methodology
SQL Injection
Authentication Bypass
Cookie Manipulation
Directory Traversal
Source Code Analysis
Linux Command Line
Burp Suite
Technical Documentation
